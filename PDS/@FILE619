//***FILE 619 is from Brian Westerman and contains the Dynamic      *   FILE 619
//*           Proclib modification, fitted to the Hercules MVS 3.8J *   FILE 619
//*           Turnkey #3 system.                                    *   FILE 619
//*                                                                 *   FILE 619
//*       Some of the members of this pds are in TSO XMIT format,   *   FILE 619
//*       which may cause a small amount of difficulty with an      *   FILE 619
//*       MVS 3.8J system, unless you know how to use Jim           *   FILE 619
//*       Morrison's XMIT370 and RECV370 programs (see File 571).   *   FILE 619
//*       Or you might want to download these members to a pc,      *   FILE 619
//*       and use the XMIT-manager program (available from a link   *   FILE 619
//*       at www.cbttape.org) to look at the $SMPLIST at least.     *   FILE 619

//*       The modification allows execution of JCL which looks      *   FILE 619
//*       like this:                                                *   FILE 619
//*                                                                 *   FILE 619

//*     This will cause the converter to first look in              *   FILE 619
//*     "MY.PROC.LIBRARY" for the procedure "MYPROC" and if not     *   FILE 619
//*     found there, it will then search the normal JES2            *   FILE 619
//*     concatenation.  If you had changed the 'SYSPROC=YES' to     *   FILE 619
//*     'SYSPROC=NO', then the search for the procedure "MYPROC"    *   FILE 619
//*     would have ended with the search of 'MY.PROC.LIBRARY',      *   FILE 619
