INSTALLATION WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER YOU WANT TO SUBMIT THE SMP4
JOB (WHICH IS THE SAFEST AND EASIEST) OR YOU CAN INSTALL MANUALLY.
THIS UPDATE IS SHIPPED ON A "TAPE" WHICH CONTAINS BOTH THE ORIGINAL
AND THE DYNAMIC PROCLIB VERSION OF THE SYS1.LPALIB MODULES
IEFVH1 AND IEFNB903.  IF YOU CHOOSE YOU CAN JUST UPDATE THOSE MODULES
IN SYS1.LPALIB (ALONG WITHT HE CHANGES TO THE JES2 PROCEDURE) AND RE-IPL
A CLPA, THIS WILL TOTALLY ACTIVATE DYNAMIC PROCLIB SUPPORT.
.
THE STEPS ARE OUTLINED FOR INSTALLATION AND THEN DESCRIBED:
1) LOOK AT THIS PARTITIONED DATASET.
2) MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR MVSRES,
   THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS, (SINCE YOU'RE ON A PC AFTER ALL),
   IS TO NAVIGATE WITH WINDOWS EXPLORER TO YOUR MVS/DASD DIRECTORY
   AND THEN RIGHT CLICK ON YOUR MVSRES.148 FILE (OR WHATEVER YOU CALLED
   YOUR MVSRES, THEN SELECT 'COPY' FROM THE RIGHT-CLICK BOX.
   THEN JUST MOVE YOUR MOUSE TO A BLANK AREA OF THE SAME DIRECTORY
   AND RIGHT-CLICK, SELECT "PASTE" FROM THE RIGHT-CLICK BOX AND
   YOU WILL NOW HAVE A COPY OF YOUR MVSRES VOLUME WITH THE NAME
   "COPY OF MVSRES.148".
3) UPDATE THE JES2 PROCEDURE OR COPY THE JES2 PROCEDURE
   IN THIS LIBRARY TO YOUR 'SYS1.PROCLIB'.
4) SUBMIT THE DYNPROC MEMBER OF THIS LIBRARY, YOU MAY HAVE TO
   MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE JOBCARD, BUT IF YOU ARE ON THE TURNKEY
   SYSTEM THE SMPAPP AND SMPREC PROCS SHOULD BE OKAY TO USE AS-IS.
   THE FIRST STEP MAY GET A RC=4 IF YOU HAVE NOT RUN THIS BEFORE,
   ALL OTHER STEPS SHOULD GET A RC=0.
5) IPL WITH A CLPA OR MLPA, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU RAN STEP 4.
   IF YOU UPDATED DIRECTLY TO SYS1.LPALIB, THEN CLPA, IF ANYWHERE
   ELSE, THEN MLPA AND EVENTUALLY YOU WILL NEED TO COPY THE 2
   MODULES (IEFVH1 AND IEFNB903) INTO SYS1.LPALIB AND CLPA.
   THIS PROCEDURE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY CHECKED OUT, BUT IF YOU
   HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, JUST FALL BACK TO YOUR "COPY OF MVSRES.148"
   BACKUP VOLUME BY RENAMING MVSRES.148 TO SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN
   RENAMING THE "COPY OF MVSRES.148" TO MVSRES.148 AND RE-IPL.
   MAKE SURE YOU SAVE A COPY OF YOUR DYNPROC OUTPUT FOR PROBLEM
   RESOLUTION.  HERCULES HOLDS VOLUMES ALLOCATED SO IF YOU
   ARE RUNNING THE GUI, YOU WILL NEED TO POWER-OFF AND POWER-ON TO
   GET THE GUI TO RE-ALLOCATE THE NEW MVSRES.  IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO
   THIS TROUBLE, PLEASE CALL ME SO THAT I CAN FIX WHATEVER YOUR
   PROBLEM WAS.  THIS IS THE VIRTUAL POWER-OFF NOT YOUR PC'S POWER
   BUTTON.
.
LONGER DESCRIPTION:
THERE ARE SEVERAL SMALL STEPS TO INSTALLING DYNAMIC PROCLIB, THE FIRST
ONE IS TO UPDATE THE JES2 PROCEDURE IN PROCLIB TO ADD THE DYNAMIC
CONCATENATION LIST, THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SAME AS YOUR CURRENT PROC00
DD CONCATENATION SO YOU CAN JUST REPLICATE THOSE LINES IN THE PROC. YOU
SHOULD CHANGE THE PROC00 TO IEF0PDSI.  I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS DD NAME
WAS SELECTED, I SUPPOSE THAT THE PERSON WHO ORIGINALLY WROTE THE SUPPORT
WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT CONFLICT WITH ANYTHING.
.
YOU WILL NEED TO REPLICATE THIS CONCATENATION(IEF0PDSI) FOR EACH
CONVERTER THAT YOU HAVE RUNNING ON YOUR SYSTEM.  IF YOU ARE RUNNING
THE TURNKEY #3 SYSTEM, THEN YOU HAVE 2 CONVERTERS, SO YOU WILL NEED
A IEF0PDSI AND AN IEF1PDSI.  IF YOU HAVE MORE CONVERTERS YOU SHOULD
REPLICATE THE CONCATENATION ONCE FOR EACH CONVERTER.  YOU JUST REPLACE
THE SINGLE DIGIT NUMBER AFTER THE "IEF" WITH THE HEXADECIMAL NUMBER
SEQUENTIALLY FOR EACH OF THE CONVERTERS THAT YOU HAVE RUNNING UP TO
THE MAX 16 CONVERTERS (0,1,2,...A,B,C,D,E,F).  IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN
16 CONVERTERS, THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER, OR REWRITE THE
CODE TO SUPPORT MORE.
.
AT THIS POINT, YOU SHOULD RE-IPL JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DIDN'T
MAKE ANY SPELLING ERRORS.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T WANT TO DO A LOT OF TYPING, I HAVE A
JES2 PROC FROM THE DEFAULT TURNKEY#3 SYSTEM IN THIS LIBRARY WITH THE
NAME "JES2".  YOU CAN JUST COPY THIS TO YOUR SYS1.PROCLIB AND SKIP
THE IPL SINCE I DON'T MAKE ERRORS :)
.
THE NEXT STEP IS EITHER TO RUN THE DYNPROC MEMBER OF THIS LIBRARY
(WHICH IS THE SMP4 JOB TO INSTALL ALL OF THE UPDATES(THERE ARE 6))
OR YOU CAN JUST COPY THE LOAD MODULES FROM THE SECOND FILE ON THE
TAPE THAT YOU RECEIVED THIS ON TO YOUR SYS1.LPALIB.  ALTERNATIVELY
YOU COULD COPY THEM TO AN MLPA LIBRARY AND IPL WITH THE MLPA OPTION,
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.  IF YOU ARE RUNNING TURNKEY#3, THEN YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THE SMP4 JOB OR JUST COPYING THE MODULES BECAUSE THEY
HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVLY TESTED.  ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, YOU WILL HAVE TO
IPL WITH A CLPA (OR MLPA) TO ACTIVATE THE CHANGES.
.
THE ADVANTAGE TO RUNNING THE SMP4 JOB IS THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT LOSING THE MODS SHOULD YOU INSTALL SOME CHANGES TO YOUR SYSTEM
LATER.  I SEPARATED THE ACCEPT JOB TO A SEPARATE MEMBER (ACCEPT) JUST
IN CASE YOU WANT TO DO A SYSGEN IN THE FUTURE, (ONE OF THE CHANGES IS
TO SGIEF441 WHICH IS NEEDED DURING SYSGEN).  I SUGGEST THAT AT SOME
POINT, YOU RUN THE ACCEPT JOB, BUT YOU CAN TAKE YOUR TIME, (UNLESS
YOU ARE BURNING UP TO DO A SYSGEN SOON, IN WHICH CASE YOUR SHOULD RUN
THE ACCEPT JOB).
.
YOU CAN ALSO DECIDE TO INSTALL THIS THING MANUALLY, IN WHICH CASE
YOU ASSEMBLE THE IEFVPP MODULE INTO A OBJ LIBRARY (USE IEFVPP$), AND
COPY THE OBJECT CODE INTO THE STEP2 MEMBER, YOU THEN RUN STEPS 1-5
(YOU WILL NEED TO USE THE -A VERSIONS IN MOST CASES I.E. STEP3A)
USE OF THE DYNAMIC PROCLIB SUPPORT IS REALLY SIMPLE:

  DIRECTIONS FOR USING DYNAMIC PROCLIB:
 THE USER WISHING TO SUPPLY A PRIVATE PROCLIB NEED ONLY
 CODE ONE OR MORE DD STATEMENTS (FOLLOWING THE NORMAL
 RULES OF CONCATENATION) WITH THE DD NAME OF "JOBPROC".
 THE JOBPROC DD MUST APPEAR BEFORE THE FIRST EXEC STATE-
 MENT OF A JOB.  THE ONLY JCL KEYWORD PARAMETERS SUPPORTED
 ARE DSN, DISP, UNIT, VOL=SER, VOL=REF, AND SYSPROC.  USE
 OF OTHER JCL PARAMETERS MAY CAUSE ERRORS OR MAY BE IGNORED.
 DSN IS MANDATORY.  DISP CAN ONLY BE "SHR".  UNIT AND VOL
 ARE NECESSARY ONLY IF THE DATA SET IS NOT CATALOGUED (VIA
 MASTER AND ALIASES - JOBCAT IS NOT USED).  SYSPROC INDICATES
 THE CONCATENATION (SYSPROC=YES) OR NON-CONCATENATION
 (SYSPROC=NO) OF THE SYSTEM PROCLIBS WITH THE USER SUPPLIED
 PROCLIBS.  THE DEFAULT IS SYSPROC=YES.
.
FOR EXAMPLE:
//BRIAN    JOB (ASSEMBLY),'SYSTEMS*BRIAN',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A,
//         NOTIFY=BRIAN
//JOBPROC  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=MY.PROC.LIBRARY,SYSPROC=YES
//STEP1    EXEC  MYPROC
/*
.
THIS WILL CASE THE CONVERTER TO FIRST LOOK IN "MY.PROC.LIBRARY" FOR
THE PROCEDURE "MYPROC" AND IF NOT FOUND THERE, IT WILL THEN SEARCH
THE NORMAL JES2 CONCATENATION. IF YOU HAD CHANGED THE 'SYSPROC=YES'
TO 'SYSPROC=NO', THEN THE SEACH FOR THE PROCEDURE "MYPROC" WOULD
HAVE ENDED WITH THE SEARCH OF 'MY.PROC.LIBRARY', AND IF NOT FOUND
A JCL ERROR WOULD HAVE RESULTED.
.
GOOD LUCK, AND HAVE FUN,
.
